abstract: Patients with COVID-19 are frequently reported to have liver injuries and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Here, we aim to investigate the underlying clinical aspects related to these symptoms.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Liver and GI symptoms lead to prolonged disease progression and higher mortality rates in older COVID-19 patients with a history of smoking. These symptoms may be overlooked during the course of illness but appear to be more insidious than respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
